# Interstellar Time
Prepare yourself for your trip to Mars and set your clock to Mars time. Use this app to find out the time on Mars. Did you know that a day on Mars has 40 extra minutes as compared to Earth? 

This app calculates the time on Mars in relation to a "Time Zero", set either by default or triggered by the user. Time moves 2.7% slower than on Earth, hence making the days longer. 

## To install and get started:
* `git clone` the repo.
* `npm install` to install dependencies.
* `npm start` to launch the app in [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view the app in development mode. 

## TODO: 
* Use flipcards to view planets.
* Add remaining planets
* Map planets wrt sun and current position in the solar system 

### Time spent on this app: 24 - 30 hours.
